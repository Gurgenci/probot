            <p><strong>Q:</strong> /Users/Halim/git/probot/.venv/bin/python /Users/Halim/git/probot/ute.py
<strong>A:</strong> DiaryLast Thursday I went to a funeral.  I should say a Memorial Ceremony. It was held in the West End Sails Rugby Club building shown above.Let me start at the beginning. In 1983, I was hired as a post-doc at The University of Queensland Solar Energy Research Center, where I met Peter. I was interested in methods of converting solar energy into electricity, his topic was solar drying of agricultural produce and minerals. Meliz and I were renting in Highgate Hill, Torbreck, which I wrote about earlier;  and Peter and his wife had a house down near the river. Meliz and I were newly married; they had been for four years.  Their first daughter was four years old when we met and the second was born soon. We would see each other as a family.Then I left the university.  I started for a manufacturing company, which in a year moved to Melbourne and we moved with it.  Peter also left the university and started working as research manager at an international HVAC equipment manufacturer, first in Singapore and then in China. I think it was as late as 2010 when I saw Peter again.  In Brisbane, where we both had returned.While watching the photos screened during the ceremony, those early days came to mind. I shared two memories of Pete on the microphone:It was 1984. Peter had begun a new project to develop an industrial dryer using microwave-assisted solar heat. Microwave ovens were new. Peter had bought a domestic unit and was exploring how to take it apart and use the transformer and magnetron inside. He was a good engineer and he did a good job at the end.  I remember our conversations when he was worrying about the correct construction of the wave guide etc. Back then, the microwave was an unknown, somewhat magical <a href="http://phenomenon.In">phenomenon.In</a> 1983, a few people went to an international meeting on Solar Energy in Perth, Western Australia. One evening in Perth, Peter, me and a Dutch friend (I think Frank) decided to have dinner somewhere different. Frank said there were Dutch/Indonesian restaurants in Perth that weren't in Brisbane at the time, and he suggested we had Risjtafen in one of them. Risjtafen is like the meals we now call degustation, but the product given on each plate was much smaller. I think we tasted 50 different flavors that evening. We were very hungry because it took us two hours to find a restaurant.  This was before smartphones and Google. Peter and I patiently waited for Frank to find a restaurant. I think it is a good virtue to be a patient and helpful in such situations. Being impatient and blaming the lead does not bring any benefit anyway. I had approved of Peter's attitude, whom I had met only a few months ago.Returning from China, Peter settled back in the West End, the same suburb where he lived forty years ago. He loved that neighborhood. Maybe that's why their daughters chose the West End rugby club for the memorial service.West End is a neighborhood close to the city center. You can even walk to the CBD if necessary. In the 1980s, the West End was a place occupied by mostly Greek, Italian and Turkish immigrants and some bohemians and retired low-income single old men. Except for Torbrek on the hill, the remaining residences were detached houses with gardens. It has changed a lot now. Here's the new West End:The place you see below was a run-down concrete building forty years ago. It housed a branch of a chain supermarket called 'Jack the Slasher'. Everything was on shelves in boxes, customers would pick things themselves and pack them themselves too.  I went to Jack the Slasher a few times but I preferred Woolworth or Coles, which offered more choice and better quality goods, even if you had to pay a little more. Today, Jack The Slasher is no more. Its place in West End is occupied by Coles: Share2Share this postConspiracy Theories - Part 1halimgur.substack.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther2SharePreviousNext2 CommentsShare this discussionConspiracy Theories - Part 1halimgur.substack.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherEren ElsewhereMental Fortress Aug 24, 2023Interesting writing, as usual.

<p>Pascal  HagiEvening time at the end of another hot day.  I called the birds in.  Pascal wanted to chat:Usually this chat continues but I found it difficult to record the video on my phone while maintaining a conversation.  I cut it short.What I readI finished reading Lola in the Mirror by Trent Dalton. This is about a 17-year old girl and her mother living in a broken car in a parkland area along the river in West End.  Trent Dalton is a very talented journalist and he describes the homeless floater community of Brisbane very well.  The book is not however about the wretched of the earth.  All of the floaters have their own reasons to be homeless each has interesting stories.  But the main plot is about the girl and her mother and an event in their past that put them on the run.Lola is a character painted on a cracked mirror that this girl talks when she needs companionship.  The girl is an artist and every chapter starts with one of her drawings.  This sketch below is how she depicts her mother.  Behind is the city silhouette from West End.  Something evil seems to be coming out of the river.You may remember West End from one of my previous blog posts.  There, I was telling about its Bohemian and working-class past and how shiny it looked now.  From Trent Dalton’s book I understand that packets of old West End are still alive today behind all the new modern buildings.  I would have loved to discuss this book with my dear friend late Peter Jolly. He spent his last few years in West End and his wife said that he would spend his days walking around the streets and chatting up people.  I am sure he would be aware of the homeless communities Trent Dalton wrote about in this book.One of the characters in this book lived in Torbreck, the building that was our first home when we got married.Incidentally, Trent Dalton’s first book Boy Swallows Universe has become a Netflix series.  It starts screening in January 2024.Zika StatisticsMr Zika sold his bakery to a Japanese baker.  The buyer said that he would continue making Zika’s breads and add Japanese pastries to the menu.  I could see the difference from the sourdough rye statistics.  The new sourdough rye bread is doughier and heavier.  The original purpose of keeping these statistics is no longer valid but I will continue this section to see how a change of the baker would change them.Here you will see how the height and weight of the rye sourdough bread changes from week to week: The date for Day 0 is 4 October 2023.

<p>Pascal  Hagi The other day, Hagi flied onto my shoulder and started licking inside my ear. That is what he does.  Pascal does not care for my earwax but is jealous when I seem to caremore for Hagi.  So, while Hagi was drilling into my ear channel, Pascal also came and bit my earlobe.  He did not bite hard enough to make it bleed but it was very painful.  I shooed both of them into their cage and closed their door.  Below, you see see Pascal repenting: “No biting … no biting”. What I read</p>
<p>UQ Lakes open againThe rebuilding of the lakes area on our university campus is finally finished.  It looks pretty but it is difficult to understand why it took two years and possibly tens of millions of dollars to get here:Birds, fish and turtles are not back yet but I expect them brought back pretty soon.  At least insects are back, apparently:They say the insect population will naturally increase and will attract other animals.</p>

<p>DiaryRain or Sunshine, the Lawn must be MowedThe day started very hot yesterday.  Usually, such starts lead to an afternoon thunderstorm when it is summer in Brisbane.  I thought that I had better mow the lawn before rain with the new lawnmower I bought.  Here is me with my wide hat to protect my face from cancer-causing rays of Brisbane summer sun:The blue cloudless sky you saw in the photo turned dark grey in the late afternoon and we had drenching rain for several hours and winds exceeding 150 km/h in parts of the city.  The power was cut off at Taylans’ home in Mooroka and they stayed with us last night.  Their power has not been reconnected yet.  The Weather Bureau expects more thunderstorms.  They are probably here tonight too. We are very happy top have them with us especially Eleanor.</p>
