<p><strong>Query</strong> : What is the local government debt in China?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : The local government debt in China in the year 2020 approached 90 trillion yuan, which is approximately 12.49 trillion U.S. dollars, and this equated to 88% of the country's GDP at the time【13†source】.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : Who did this study?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : The study on China's local government debt was conducted by Professor Li and his PhD student【13†source】.</p>

<p><strong>Query</strong> : What is the per capita debt and how does it compare against salaries?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : The per capita debt in China, based on a total debt of 90 trillion yuan, is 75,000 yuan per person for the 1.2 billion Chinese living in the Republic of China. To give context to this amount, it was mentioned that this figure of 75,000 yuan was the annual salary of a typical young mechanical engineer in Luoyang in 2019【53†source】.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : WHat is the result of the last Taiwanese election?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : During the last Taiwanese election held on Saturday, 13 January, the current president was re-elected. Lai, presumably the opposing candidate, received only 40% of the votes in Taiwan's first-past-the-post system, and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is pro-independence, lost its parliamentary majority【0†source】.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : Is Lai pro-independence?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : Yes, Lai and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), are pro-independence【0†source】.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : What book did win the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : The 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was shared by Hernan Diaz's &quot;Trust&quot; and Barbara Kingsolver’s &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot;【0†source】.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : What is the book &quot;Trust&quot; about?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : The book &quot;Trust&quot; has a complex plot that isn't fully revealed until past its midpoint, transcending a mere critique of capitalism. It's structured as separate books, each with their own plot. The first section, titled &quot;Bonds,&quot; centers on Benjamin Rask, a wealthy American financier with a reputation for being a ruthless stock market wizard. He is married to a woman who is interesting and talented in her own right. The theme seems to delve into the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Rask, with the narrative written in the third person, exploring the disparities between American and European attitudes and sensibilities. The richness of detail and the focus on wealth and the lives of the wealthy also suggest a significant emphasis on social and personal dynamics within the context of financial power【1†source】.</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : How is hydrogen produced?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Query</strong> : WHat is a typical electrolyser efficiency?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong> : A typical electrolyzer efficiency is around 55% under the assumption that the cost of electricity is the only production cost. This calculation may underestimate the efficiency if there are significant costs in addition to the cost of electricity【120†source】.</p>
