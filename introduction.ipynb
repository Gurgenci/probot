    "but were lacking in one way or another. I did not want to invest my time in a tool \\\n",
    "that would not be around long.  The situation has now changed. \\\n",
    "I am happy to say that the OpenAI offerings early November provides a path for people like me to develop tools to \\\n",
    "train LLMs to competence levels of a college graduate. They are not perfect but good enough to provide a starting point.\\n\\n\\\n",
    "I am planning to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to do this. Before I justify this choice, I should give \\\n",

    "## Fine Tuning ##\\n\\n\\\n",
    "This method is a repetition of the initial training of the LLM.  Remember that the model is already trained on \\\n",
    "a large corpus of text.  The fine tuning is done on a smaller corpus of text that is specific to the task at hand. \\\n",
    "In human education terms, this is similar to recitation learning like in islamic madrasas.  The madrasa students keeo \\\n",
    "reciting religious texts without necessarily understanding context.  Similarly, in fine-tuning, the LLM is \\\n",
    "given a body of text in a specific domain and is trained to tease out the probabilistic relations connecting \\\n",
    "different words to each other in this specific domain, which may be slightly different from the original relations \\\n",
    "developed using an entire corpus of general internet and other sources. As in its original initial training, there is \\\n",
    "no contextual knowledge relations here just probabilities. \\n\\n\\\n",
    "Either the entire parameter set (weights and biases) of the LLM is fine tuned or only the last layer is fine tuned. \\\n",
    "The fine-tuning starts with unsupervised learning, which is usually reinforced by human feedback.\\n\\n\\\n",
    "I decided not to use fine-tuning because at the end the answer will still be probabilistic and not contextual.\\\n",
    "A probalistic answer may be adequate in non-numerical fields such as law but it is totally unacceptable \\\n",
    "in say engineering where categorical answers are needed and if a numerical response is asked for, \\\n",
    "it should be accurate with reliabilities exceeding 99%\\n\\n\")\n",
    "MD.write(\"In a way, it is good that there are good reasons for me not to pick fine-tuning as my method \\\n",
    "of choice because I do not have access to the computing power needed to do fine-tuning. It is possible \\\n",
    "to use OpenaAI API but this would be expensive.  I also think some heuristic methods need to be used in addition to \\\n",
    "running fine-tuning through the API and I do not think this would be possible when using the OpenAI as a black box.\\n\\n\")\n",
    "MD.write(\"## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) ##\\n\\n\")\n",
    "MD.write(\"If fine-tuning is like recitation learning, RAG is like contextual learning.  In RAG, there is \\\n",
    "a retriever program between the user and the LLM.  When the user asks a question, the retriever program \\\n",
    "retrieves the most relevant text from a corpus of text and feeds it to the LLM.  The LLM then generates \\\n",
    "a response.  The response is then fed back to the retriever program to determine if the response is \\\n",
    "relevant to the question.  If it is not, the retriever program retrieves another text from the corpus \\\n",
    "and the process is repeated until a relevant response is obtained.\\n\\n\\\n",
    "Most of the current interest in RAG is in building company chatbots where the corpus of text is the \\\n",
    "company's knowledge base.  The retriever program is usually a search engine. The corpus of text \\\n",
    "precedes RAG and is developed independent of the RAG effort.\\n\\n\\\n",
    "This is not my interest.  I am interested in developing a corpus of text that is specific to a \\\n",
    "specific area in which I have knowledge.  In other words, I approach RAG like writing a textbook \\\n",
    "for a course.  The difference is that writing a textbook for a LLM is probably different from writing.\\n\\n\\\n",
